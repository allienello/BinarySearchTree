This project had two parts. In the first part, I constructed a binary search tree and node class, with some basic functions. In the second part, I expanded the functionality of the binary search tree to allow removal and balancing of nodes.

Some of these functions were implemented recursively as it was considered best practice. Use of global variables was not allowed in this project.

The Main.cpp file was given by the instructor, and I updated it to do these additional tasks:
•	Display the list in (LMR,MLR,RML) order
•	Display the count and depth of the tree
•	Remove a value from the tree

This project was for my introduction to programming II class at university. Using my knowledge from class, I implemented the necessary algorithms/code. I also used my course materials (lecture slides and textbooks) and advice from the professor.
